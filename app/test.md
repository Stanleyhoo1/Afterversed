## Step-by-Step Guide for Post-Death Arrangements in London, UK

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (First Few Days)

These are the first steps to take following the death.

1.  **Obtain a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death:**
    *   **Where:** If the death occurred in a hospital, a doctor there will usually issue this. If at home, you will need to contact the deceased's GP or NHS 111. A doctor will attend to confirm the death and issue the certificate.
    *   **Purpose:** This document is essential for registering the death.
    *   **Coroner's Involvement:** In certain circumstances (e.g., sudden, unexplained, or violent death, or if the deceased had not seen a doctor recently), the doctor may refer the death to the **Coroner for Inner London (South)** or the relevant Coroner's Office for the borough where the death occurred. This can delay the issue of the medical certificate and registration.

2.  **Locate the Will:**
    *   **Action:** It's crucial to find the deceased's Will as soon as possible. It usually names the Executors who are responsible for administering the estate, and outlines their wishes for the funeral and distribution of assets.
    *   **Typical Locations:** Safely stored at home, with a solicitor, or in a bank's safe deposit box.

3.  **Inform Close Family and Friends:**
    *   **Action:** Share the sad news with immediate family members and close friends. You may wish to delegate this task to another family member or friend to alleviate some pressure.

4.  **Secure the Deceased's Property:**
    *   **Action:** As the surviving spouse, you are likely already residing at the property. Ensure the property is secure.
    *   **Financial Safeguards:** Gather any immediate financial documents, and ensure valuables are safe.

### Phase 2: Registering the Death and Arranging the Funeral (Within 5 Working Days)

This phase covers the official registration and initial funeral plans.

1.  **Register the Death:**
    *   **Timeframe:** You must register the death within **5 days** in England and Wales. If the Coroner is involved, this timeframe may be extended.
    *   **Who can register:** Usually a close relative (like a spouse), someone present at the death, or an executor of the Will.
    *   **Where:** At a **Register Office** in the London borough where the death occurred. You will need to book an appointment.
        *   *Example:* If death occurred in Westminster, register at Westminster Register Office. You can find your local Register Office by searching "Register a death [London Borough Name]" on GOV.UK.
    *   **Documents to Take:**
        *   Medical Certificate of Cause of Death.
        *   Deceased's passport, birth certificate, marriage certificate, NHS medical card (if available).
        *   Details of the deceased: full name, date and place of birth, last address, occupation, maiden name (if applicable), spouse's full name and occupation (if married).
    *   **Documents You Will Receive:**
        *   **Death Certificate:** You will receive a copy, but it is highly recommended to purchase several certified copies (at a small fee) as many organisations will require them.
        *   **Green Form (Certificate for Burial or Cremation):** This is essential for arranging the funeral.
        *   **Form BD8 (for the Department for Work and Pensions - DWP):** This form relates to benefits.

2.  **Arrange the Funeral:**
    *   **Action:** Use the Green Form obtained from the Register Office to arrange the funeral with a funeral director. The Will may contain specific funeral wishes.
    *   **Funeral Directors:** They can guide you through all aspects of arranging the funeral, including burial or cremation, ceremony details, and necessary paperwork.
    *   **Costs:** Funeral costs can be significant. Keep all receipts as these are expenses that can be paid from the deceased's estate.
    *   **Financial Assistance:** You may be eligible for a **Funeral Expenses Payment** from the DWP if you receive certain benefits. Apply via GOV.UK.

### Phase 3: Dealing with the Will, Probate, and Estate Administration

This is the legal process of managing the deceased's assets and debts.

1.  **Understand the Role of Executors:**
    *   **Action:** The Will names one or more Executors who are legally responsible for administering the estate. As the surviving spouse, you might be named as an Executor.
    *   **Duties:** Executors gather information on all assets and liabilities, pay any outstanding debts and taxes, and distribute the estate according to the Will.

2.  **Determine if a Grant of Probate is Needed:**
    *   **What is Probate?** A Grant of Probate is a legal document issued by the Probate Registry confirming the Executor's authority to deal with the deceased's estate.
    *   **Jointly Owned Property (Crucial for your context):**
        *   **Joint Tenants:** If the property was owned as **"joint tenants,"** the deceased's share automatically passes to you as the surviving joint owner by "survivorship." This transfer happens outside the Will and typically doesn't require a Grant of Probate for the property itself, though you will need to update the Land Registry.
        *   **Tenants in Common:** If the property was owned as **"tenants in common,"** the deceased's share does not automatically pass to you but forms part of their estate and will be distributed according to their Will. A Grant of Probate would be required to deal with this share.
    *   **Other Assets:** Even if the property passes by survivorship, a Grant of Probate will likely be needed to deal with other assets (e.g., bank accounts above a certain value, shares, investments) or if the total value of the estate exceeds certain thresholds (typically £5,000-£15,000, though this varies by institution).
    *   **Recommendation:** Given there is a Will, it is highly likely that a Grant of Probate will be needed, even if only for other assets.

3.  **Value the Estate for Inheritance Tax (IHT):**
    *   **Action:** The Executors must identify and value all assets (property, bank accounts, investments, personal possessions, pensions, insurance policies) and liabilities (debts, funeral expenses).
    *   **Inheritance Tax (IHT) Forms:**
        *   **IHT205 (No IHT Due):** For estates where no IHT is likely to be due (e.g., estate value below the IHT threshold, or passes entirely to a spouse/charity). You still need to submit this form if probate is required and the estate is over a certain value.
        *   **IHT400 (IHT Due or Complex Estate):** For estates where IHT is likely to be due, or if the estate is complex. This is a much more detailed form.
        *   **Spouse Exemption:** Transfers between spouses (and civil partners) are generally exempt from IHT, meaning you can often inherit your deceased spouse's entire estate without paying IHT. Additionally, your deceased spouse's unused IHT nil-rate band (currently £325,000) and residence nil-rate band (currently £175,000) can be transferred to you, potentially allowing a combined IHT allowance of up to £1 million.
    *   **Payment of IHT:** If IHT is due, it generally needs to be paid by the end of the sixth month after the death. You can sometimes pay IHT before receiving the Grant of Probate from funds held in the deceased's accounts.

4.  **Apply for Grant of Probate:**
    *   **Form:** Complete **Form PA1P** (Application for a Grant of Probate - where there is a Will). This can be done online via GOV.UK or by post.
    *   **Documents to Submit:** Original Will, IHT forms (IHT205 or IHT400 with any supporting schedules), death certificate.
    *   **Where:** Applications are handled by the **HM Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS) Probate Registry**. While the application is largely online or via post, there isn't a single physical "Probate Registry" in London you visit to submit applications, rather the central processing centre.
    *   **Timeframe:** Obtaining a Grant of Probate can take several weeks to many months, depending on the complexity of the estate, whether IHT is payable, and current processing times.

5.  **Administer the Estate:**
    *   **Action:** Once the Grant of Probate is received, the Executors can formally collect assets, pay off any outstanding debts (e.g., utility bills, loans, credit cards), and then distribute the remaining assets to the beneficiaries as per the Will.
    *   **Professional Advice:** For complex estates, particularly those involving IHT, trusts, or property, it is highly advisable to seek assistance from a **probate solicitor** or specialist. They can handle the entire process, ensuring compliance with legal requirements.

### Phase 4: Notifying Organisations and Dealing with Ongoing Matters

This phase focuses on informing relevant parties and managing ongoing financial and administrative tasks.

1.  **Use the "Tell Us Once" Service:**
    *   **Action:** This is a free service offered by most local councils, including those in London. The registrar who registers the death will usually provide you with a unique reference number to use this service.
    *   **Purpose:** It allows you to report a death to many government organisations in one go, including HMRC, DWP, Passport Office, and DVLA. This significantly reduces the administrative burden.
    *   **Where:** You can use the service online (GOV.UK) or by phone.

2.  **Contact Banks, Building Societies, and Financial Institutions:**
    *   **Action:** Notify all banks, building societies, and other financial institutions where the deceased held accounts or investments. Provide them with a certified copy of the Death Certificate and the Grant of Probate (once obtained).
    *   **Joint Accounts:** Funds in joint accounts will typically automatically pass to you as the surviving account holder. You will still need to inform the bank so they can update their records.

3.  **Notify Utility Companies and Service Providers:**
    *   **Action:** Contact electricity, gas, water, broadband, phone, and council tax providers.
    *   **Council Tax:** As the surviving spouse, you will usually become solely responsible for Council Tax. Inform your local London borough council's Council Tax department. You may be eligible for a discount if you are the sole adult occupant.

4.  **Contact Pension Providers and Insurance Companies:**
    *   **Action:** Inform any private or occupational pension providers and life insurance companies. They will advise on any benefits or payouts.
    *   **State Pension:** The DWP will be notified via "Tell Us Once," but you may need to follow up if you were also receiving benefits linked to your spouse.

5.  **Inform Other Relevant Organisations:**
    *   **DVLA:** If the deceased held a driving licence or owned a vehicle.
    *   **Passport Office:** To cancel the deceased's passport.
    *   **Employer:** If the deceased was working.
    *   **Land Registry:** Crucial for jointly owned property.
        *   **Action:** If the property was held as "joint tenants," you will need to apply to the Land Registry to remove the deceased's name from the title. This is typically done using **Form DJP**. If held as "tenants in common" and a Grant of Probate was required, the Land Registry will be updated after the property has been legally transferred according to the Will.
    *   **HMRC (Income Tax/National Insurance):** Even if you used "Tell Us Once," you may need to file a final tax return for the deceased's income up to the date of death. HMRC will also need to know about any income generated by the estate during administration.

### Phase 5: Concluding the Estate and Post-Administration

1.  **Prepare Estate Accounts:**
    *   **Action:** Executors should keep detailed records of all transactions (income, expenditure, assets, liabilities) during the estate administration. These accounts should be prepared and shared with the beneficiaries.

2.  **Distribute the Estate:**
    *   **Action:** Once all debts and taxes are paid, and the Grant of Probate is received, the Executors can distribute the remaining assets to the beneficiaries as outlined in the Will.

### Support Resources

Please remember that you do not have to go through this alone. There is a great deal of support available.

*   **Bereavement Counselling:**
    *   **Cruse Bereavement Support:** Offers free confidential support for bereaved people. Helpline: 0808 808 1677. Website: www.cruse.org.uk
    *   **Local Hospices:** Many hospices offer bereavement services to the wider community, not just those linked to their patients.
    *   **GP:** Your General Practitioner can provide support and refer you to local mental health services or counsellors.
*   **Government Services:**
    *   **GOV.UK:** The official government website provides comprehensive information on what to do after a death, including links to specific forms and services.
